  <!-- the link element is used to let the html document know that a css file is linked to it 
  so that we can modify the elements by the use of the css in an external way

  in case of html - the file by convention should be called index.html 
  but for css files we can call it whatever we want -->

  <!-- 
    so the thing is that we can write css code either in internal or in inline ways 
    but that would create problems in the future ,cause lets say we write the css in internal way so what will happen that if 
    there is 500+ lines of code in css it will bloat the entire html document 

    also we never mix internal and inline css together , we call it separation of concerns

      <p>
        All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is HTML?
      </h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <stong>H</stong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="first_li">
          The opening tag
        </li>
        <li>
          The closing tag
        </li>
        <li>
          The actual element
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You can learn more at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why should you learn HTML?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="first_li">
          To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
        </li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>
          To build web applications
        </li>
        <li>
          To impress friends
        </li>
        <li>
          To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!
