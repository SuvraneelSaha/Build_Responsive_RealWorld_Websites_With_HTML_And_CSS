text-transform property 
font-style property
font-family property

The default text size is 16px as per the browsers

there can be descendant selectors and also nested descendant selectors
but the problem is that we are using more and more html elements inside our
css and god forbid if the html elements are changed then the styling will also get changed 
then that will definately create a huge problem for us 

so we should not be using the html selectors in this way rather we can 
use class id and names of html elements

 why we rarely use ids and often use classes 
the reason is that ids can be used for only one element wherease we can use 
classes for many different elements . 
and by doing that we are making our code future proof so that whenever we 
want to add something similar to that we can just use the class attribute and put 
the same name and in this way the same styling will be added  

There are two mainly two types to define colors in css 
one is rgb/rgba and one is hexadecimal values

the rgb stands for red green blue
rgba means additional alpha which stands for transparency 

ex - rgb(255,255,255) stands for white color
and another example - rgba(255,255,255,1) means white color but transparent 
the alpha value ranges from 0 to 1 (decimal) values

in general case we use hexadecimal values 
example #00ffff 
shorthand way : #0ff if all the values of r g b are same 
then we use the shorthand


The theory of grey color 

there are 256 pure grey colors 
if the values match then it will become a grey color

rgb(144,144,144) this is a grey color


Font weight is used for boldness of the text or alphabets
