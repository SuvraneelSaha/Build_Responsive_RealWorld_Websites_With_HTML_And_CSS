text-transform property 
font-style property
font-family property

The default text size is 16px as per the browsers

there can be descendant selectors and also nested descendant selectors
but the problem is that we are using more and more html elements inside our
css and god forbid if the html elements are changed then the styling will also get changed 
then that will definately create a huge problem for us 

so we should not be using the html selectors in this way rather we can 
use class id and names of html elements
